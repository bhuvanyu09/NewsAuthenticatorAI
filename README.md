## About the Project
Fake news and scams are prevalent in today's digital world. This project aims to mitigate their impact by providing an easy-to-use web interface that allows users to verify the authenticity of news articles.

### Key Objectives:
1. Accurately classify news articles as fake or real.
2. Offer an interactive web interface for ease of use.
3. Provide an extendable framework for scam detection.

---

## Features
- **Text Preprocessing**: Uses stemming, stopword removal, and TF-IDF vectorization for textual data.
- **Interactive Interface**: Built with Streamlit for a seamless user experience.
- **Logistic Regression Model**: Trained to detect fake news with high accuracy.
- **Modular Design**: Includes separate files for fake news detection and scam detection.

---

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - Pandas: Data manipulation
  - NumPy: Numerical computation
  - Scikit-learn: Machine learning
  - NLTK: Natural language processing
  - Streamlit: Web application development

---

## Dataset
The dataset for this project includes:
- Columns: `author`, `title`, `content`, and `label`
- **label**: Binary classification (0 = Real, 1 = Fake)

The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values and combined `author` and `title` fields for better feature extraction.

---

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Fake-News-Detector.git
   cd Fake-News-Detector
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Download the `train.csv` dataset and place it in the project directory.

---

## Usage
1. Launch the web application:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
2. Enter a news article in the input box.
3. The system will classify the news as **Real** or **Fake**.
